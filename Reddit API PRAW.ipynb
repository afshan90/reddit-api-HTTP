I’d assume they have less familiarity with abstract data structures, objects, control flow, functional stuff, and general software architectural and carpentry skills. Best way might be to ask what they’re interested in learning though, or help them through a project. At the very least helping them set up an IDE or Jupyter setup I’m sure will fast forward their progress, and I’d assume pandas/polars/numpy/scipy/matplotlib/seaborn stuff will be relevant.\n",
