As an energy scientist, modeling the grid, I’m always amazed how giant batteries drop the price of electricity. If you were trying to solve one of the most complex problems on the planet, and you were to think up a way to just solve the problem, and spec’d it out, chances are you’d have designed a li-ion battery storage.

Grid-Scale Battery Storage Is Quietly Revolutionizing the Energy System | WIRED,"Grid scale storage does some really interesting things to surge pricing. If you’re charging your batteries, you’re not powering the grid. So you do two things: reduce availability during slow day time hours which could lead to higher prices during slower times (depends on how many providers are charging instead of supplying). Think of it this way — if you always want to maximize your earnings, why sell during the cheap times instead of saving it for the peak periods? Storage gives you that option.

California really just needs 4 hours of storage to get through the peak.  Texas needs two days to get through a cold winter day.  Germany needs a full week for a dunkelflaute.


At the current moment Texas can't live without their gas peakers so the state is working on all kinds of ""firming"" legislation because batteries are actively putting peakers out of business.    But at the same time there is no economic incentive for longer storage.

Grid-Scale Battery Storage Is Quietly Revolutionizing the Energy System | WIRED,"The peaker isn't being decommissioned for a combined cycle.    The peaker is being decommissioned for the battery.    So there is no non-thermal power plant to take the load.


This is of course grid specific, but my grid is super spikey on a daily basis, which keeps the peakers in business.   But the peakers are what keeps the grid up and running for one cold week per winter.     If you take away the financial benefit of the daily cycle via battery, the peakers will go out of business.   And something else will need to come on for one week a year during the winter.


I'm loving the savings batteries are providing.    They are saving rate payers insane amounts of cash.    But that one winter week gets harder every year.",2025-04-27 07:48:38
Grid-Scale Battery Storage Is Quietly Revolutionizing the Energy System | WIRED,"Its all location specific but my grid has two specific issue.   First is winter storm, a roughly 2 day period where usage is higher than normal.   Second is summer peaks, air conditioning usage for 2 hours each day 


Today, gas peakers perform both of these roles.    They start up for 2 hours a day in the summer, and they run for 2 days straight that one winter week.   They get paid for both and make a nice living.


Now the two hours a day is performed by batteries at a much cheaper cost.   Thats great for rate payers, but takes an important revenue stream away from the peakers.   They can't survive off the money they make from just running 2 days a year.   So at current prices they need to close up shop leaving those 2 winter days uncovered.

One way is to own them publicly as you say.    Another way is to switch from a power-only market to a capacity market where these peakers are paid as an ancillary service.   Another way is what Texas is trying right now, every renewable generator has to also secure a dispatchable form of energy to match at their own expense.

Grid-Scale Battery Storage Is Quietly Revolutionizing the Energy System | WIRED,"The combined cycle plants which are having their output reduced by the wind and solar still exist.

Load is still well below their maximum output during the off peak time.

You don't even need to consider the wind and solar (which are still running at 30-50% of average output during dunkelflaute) to get rid of the peaker.

You have a 1GW slow plant with a 1GW peaker for a load that averages 750MW over the day and peaks at 1.5GW.

The battery fully replaces the peaker, and once you include the small increase to efficiency on the thermal plant from slower ramping, almost all of the fuel previously needed for the peaker is gone too.

All you need to do is not remove the combined cycle plant until you either have sufficient curtailment, sufficient dispatchable load, or one of your not-presently-electrified industries results in a stockpile of some fuel (whether that fuel is hydrogen derived, a hydrocarbon, or sponge iron).",2025-04-27 08:03:45

Thats before we look at life expectency.   A peaker plant is expected to last 30 years, giving you a capital cost of $30 per kw per year.    Batteries are expected to last 10 years, giving you a capital cost of $1200 per kw.     So the battery is 40 times more expensive than the gas peaker.


Yes the battery can make a little bit of money on a daily basis by taking advantage of price mis-matches, but the revenue is pretty small as 4 hour batteries are saturating this market.

Agrivoltaics for corn

Researchers have created a novel model that can help developers assess corn growth in agrivoltaic facilities. They also proposed to use **spatiotemporal shadow distribution (SSD) to optimize crop yield and power production.**

  
The researchers then used the model to test the impact of the tracker height, distance between arrays, panel angle, and the activation of the tracking system on yield. They first found that designs that lower the tracker height without impeding the movement of plant machinery should be envisioned as the overall average corn yield is a weak function of the tracker height up to 2.44 m.",2025-04-26 00:17:36

Ethanol corn uses farmland area the size of New York — could solar do it better?,"A company called [Fuel positive](https://fuelpositive.com/) in Waterloo, Ontario is looking to build some of these conversion units. In areas with a limited grid connection, my idea would be to overbuild a wind farm to capture more energy at lower wind speeds to maximize your grid output. However, your issue comes up when wind speed is at its higher range, whereby you would be exceeding the grid  and contract capacity with your maximum nameplate generation and would thus need a curtailment. In these scenarios I propose diverting that extra power towards the ammonia unit to utilize the excess green ammonia as local fertilizer with minimal transportation requirements.

Haber Bosch works at 200atm (around 3k psi) and 400-600°C. Both of which should be viable for a small-ish installation.  So, I'm not seeing an immediate issue with material or equipment from a physics standpoint.

However the single pass efficiency is rather low (15%) and recycling gases requires separation...and that requires *extremely* cold temperatures which is not viable for a small installation. Stomaching that 85% loss may be too much to make this financially viable.",2025-04-28 00:14:56

Spain hits first weekday of 100% renewable power on national grid – pv magazine International,"I work in the PV sector in Spain, and I think there are a couple of reasons for this. One irrational and one rational.

- The irrational one is some people still have unfounded beliefs that the technology is not yet fully optimized, that it is a scam or that it's not financially viable. As the situation stands now, that's all untrue. 

The tumultuous history of solar in Spain began in the mid 2000s when the left wing government was giving generous subsidies to solar projects, which at the time were based on early stage technology and were not financially viable. After the 2008 financial crisis hit the government pulled the rug on all these subsidized projects and they became ruinous experiments. The right wing government that came after disincentiviced PV self consumption further when they instated a tax for grid connected domestic and industrial PV (commonly referred to as""impuesto al sol""), which was revoked when the left wing came back to power in the late 2010s.

With all that history of uncertainty, the misconception that PV technology is a scam has become widespread, especially between right leaning rich and middle class people over 40, which are the ones who own the houses and could afford to install some panels.

- The rational objection to installing domestic PV, which is not widely thought of but I have as someone working in the industry, is that there is an insane amount of utility scale PV projects in development right now, and because of it I fear that PV in Spain will eventually ""die of success"". Let me explain.

The way the Spanish system works, only the cheapest tech available at the moment gets to inject power until demand is met. This means renewable wind and solar get in first, since they have close to no operational costs, followed by nuclear, and finally hydro and combustion which have the highest operational cost. The prize at which electricity is sold is equal to the prize of the most expensive bidder that gets into the mix, and therefore when most of the mix is renewable electricity is very cheap, and when gas powered plants get in electricity is more expensive.

The problem for people and companies who invest in PV installations is that, as more and more PV gets connected to the grid, days in which there's a lot of sun the prize of electricity will plummet, which is great for consumers in general, but sucks if you have invested in self consumption, since you are grid independent in times when electricity is very cheap and still depend on the grid when there's no sun and electricity is expensive. Under this paradigm you won't get the same return on investment you might calculate if you assume electricity costs will remain consistent.",2025-04-23 18:09:28

Spain hits first weekday of 100% renewable power on national grid – pv magazine International,"The last part is true for most european countries that in the long term pv cannibalizes itself by being too successful (merit order rule, which backfired big time in 22 with the start of the ukraine war), as for a possible tax, you can set modern pv installations to a zero grid mode which means it blocks the elecitricity into the grid out, so if a government things it can charge taxes to send energy into the grid you basically set it to this mode!

In Austria the insecurity caused by Russia gave PV installations a big boom, high energy prices fueled by anxiety of gas shortages etc... in 22 also helped to get people going into this direction. 

The funny thing is in Italy it seems to be like in Spain almost no installations. A friend of mine did a house renovation in northern italy, he built it with central european standards, aka full wall insulation, pv heatpump pool heatpump etc... he told me people are staring at his house like it is a futuristic home from the next century, but all he did is just apply central european standards to the home to get energy consumption/prices down while trying to keep the heat and cold creep out to make it comfortable!",2025-04-23 18:58:44

Spain hits first weekday of 100% renewable power on national grid – pv magazine International,"The second point is why you get storage to shift solar overproduction into the evenings and mornings (and night). Battery storage - not just mass grid storage but also home storage - has gotten stupidly cheap.

These negative prices we're seeing are simply an artifact of the storage buildup lagging behind the PV buildup. Once enough storage is deployed that will go away and prices will even out.

From what I hear from people I know who could afford solar and don't do it that ""scam"" mentality is indeed still a big factor.

It's more psychological I guess (and yeah they put their disposable income in those irrational behaviours), whereas Spain doesn't feel this urgency of having everyone put panels on their roofs.

Spain hits first weekday of 100% renewable power on national grid – pv magazine International,"You may not be aware of the power prices in germany. They are *high.* Balcony solar is super cheap. You can get a 800W system (which is the legal limit) for less than 200 Euros.

At current, average power prices (roughly 30ct/kWh) this means you have to utilize 670kWh out of your system to break even.

North facing solar produces about 55% of what south facing solar panels produce. A 800Wp south facing installation produces about 800kWh per year in germany. I.e. a north facing one will produce 440kWh.

So you are breaking even after about 1.5 years (assuming you use all that power yourself. If you're only using part of that then it will take longer of course).

With the lifetime of PV on the order of 20 years+ that's a *very* good investment.

Also I would be surprised if the lowest-of-the-low cost plug-ins we find in Lidl can last twenty years.

"US to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on south-east Asia solar panels","> It's almost like Trump doesn't like renewables or something.

He *despises* renewables.  He's in the ""but it'll ruin the views"" crowd, and both used to and currently always calls/-ed coal ""beautiful"" and ""clean"".  And he just signed four executive orders designed to boost the U.S. coal industry, outlining steps to protect coal-fired power plants and expedite leases for coal mining on federal land....

"US to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on south-east Asia solar panels","It wasn't much of a scandal, even. Some DoE loans went to a company that went under because, well, other DoE efforts were successful in driving the price of solar even lower than the one company could operate at. It was cast as some sort of corrupt sweetheart deal by the conservative propaganda engines but there was no smoke under that fire, if I recall correctly.

Unlike the massive corruption scandals happening daily under the Trump administrations, where we barely pretend that the federal contracting process exists if Musk or Trump donors are involved...

Trump et al *are* trying to kill the IRA's provisions for renewable energy growth but at a certain point, even without subsidies, renewables & batteries are simply cheaper and easier to put on the grid than *coal* plants, and aren't dependent on relatively volatile gas prices to remain economical. So these tariffs are dumb on multiple fronts, but that's the signature style of conservative governance all around the world now.",2025-04-22 20:29:52

Sorry - my comment was misleading. They aren’t US companies but companies that manufacture in the US. Q Cells, Canadian Solar, Jinko are some of the largest globally. Longi, one of the largest global players, are opening a plant with a 5GW/year capacity. 

These modules can all be sold at a steep premium, with manufacturers without locations in the US, being penalized. 

At the end of the day…it means projects are more expensive, which means the price of electricity will be higher. The cheaper a plant is built the cheaper it can bid its price. ",2025-04-24 02:41:46
